    "Summary of Hypothesis 3\n",
    "Our hypothesis that patients with fasting blood sugar levels greater than 120 mg/dl are more likely to have heart disease was not supported by the data. The chi-square test indicated that our sample size was too small to establish a significant correlation between elevated fasting blood sugar levels and the incidence of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the graph does reveal a slight increase in disease incidence among individuals with higher blood sugar levels. This observed difference is minimal and does not definitively indicate that elevated fasting sugar levels have an impact on heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately assess this hypothesis, further research with a larger sample size is necessary to provide more conclusive evidence regarding the relationship between fasting blood sugar levels and heart disease."
